# GIT
## Introduction
You need to save your code somehow. You do it for you essays in school already, you have them in all kind of places. You have essay_final.txt
on you computer, essay_final_final.txt on your thumbdrive and essay_this_is_really_the_final_one.txt on your laptop. You see the problem here?

For programming, even more so than your essays, it's imperative to save your work. So why not use dropbox? Reason is that we don't just want to
save it, we want to control it specifically. We want to have several people to work on single files, we want to go back on changes done
on files and we want to have it all available now. This is where version control comes in.

Git does what every version control system does, it makes your code available on internet so you and your team mates or code comrades can access
it from everywhere. It also handles replication of code files into everyones computer and most importantly of all, controls codes versions.
Version control can be seen as having multiple parallel versions of same thing that are developed simultaneously. Having tools to merge these
into one working version and also to go forward and back in history of changes in file or files.

There is several version control systems but best (and most difficult to grasp) is [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Git might be
mind bogling at the beginning but when you graps how it works it will let you become the
[benevolent dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) of your code.

## Getting Started
### Install Git
For installing git on your preferred platform please refer to instructions found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Create Github Account
This is not strictly speaking required, you will need some kind of server instance to operate git properly, meaning that code is replicated somewhere
where it can be accessed by everyone that requires access to it. This can be a basic server anywhere on internet or another ready made service like github
(bitbucket?). However github is the home of most open source project and thus will serve as the example on this tutorial.

[Signup to github](https://github.com/join?source=header-repo)

### Setup
Okay, you now have git freshly installed on your computer and I'm expecting it to be a UNIX based computer as previously suggested on this
tutorial, if not please refer elsewhere how to run git on Windows. Now open up your github account on browser and start a terminal session
on you computer.
