# Learning Linux
This chapter will ensure that you get started with linux on right path and learn all you
need to proceed with python web development. However as we ain't concentrating on linux
itself on this tutorial hence this will be quite simplified. You will however get going
with it and will learn as you go later on.

## What is Linux
Linux is a free operating system for your computer, just like Windows 8 or Mac OS X. 
What distinguishes Linux from the previously mentioned is that its open source, this means
that anyone can join in to develop Linux. This doesn't make it brittle however, as there
is literally thousands of volunteers working on it and everything goes through rigorous 
review and testing. This would make it in some cases even more reliable and robust than 
its propietary counter parts.

## Tutorial

following tutorial made by Ryan Chadwick, buy him a beer if you ever meet him.
